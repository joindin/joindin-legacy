## What to work on

You should work on what you want to. Our bug tracker is
here: https://joindin.jira.com

Any issues that have the "easypick" label are ones that we think
are a good starting point. This [JIRA filter](https://joindin.jira.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10510)
will give you the list of all current open issues with the "easypick" label.

If you have any problems, ask on the IRC channel or send an email to
the mailing list.


## Pull-Request workflow

When you open a PR, ensure that you enter the issue code from
JIRA into your PR description, where applicable. This helps
the systems to link what code goes with which issue and makes
it easier for us to know what has changed for the issue.
For example: JOINDIN-123. This JIRA code can be found above
the issue title on the issue view screen in JIRA.

Once you have submitted the PR, people will look at it and
provide feedback. If it cannot be applied in its current
state, then a comment will be left and the PR will then be
closed. This is because the PR queue represents all pull
requests that are ready to be applied. That is, the PR queue
is not used as a work-in-progress list.

When you have time to address the comments left on your PR,
please make the changes, push them to github and then re-open
the pull request.
