## What to work on

You should work on what you want to. Our bug tracker is 
here: https://joindin.jira.com

Any issues that have the "hackathon" label are ones that we think
are a good starting point. This [JIRA filter](https://joindin.jira.com/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10510) will give you the list of all
current issues with the "hackathon" issues. 

If you have any problems, ask on the IRC channel or send an email to
the mailing list.
